# Project State: remote-project-management

**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Started:** 2026-03-15
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-31

## Current Phase

Implementation — Phase 2 is complete at 10/10 tasks under the approved
field-level content-safety correction. Its fresh independent review passed
after one bounded fix round. Phase 3 is next and has not started.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** `spec.md` (complete)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete)
- **Plan:** plan.md (complete; ready for implementation)
- **Implementation:** implementation.md (in progress; resumed at p02-t10)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Linear integration handover reference added (`reference/linear-integration-discovery-handover.md`)
- ✓ GitHub Issues, Linear, and Jira provider dossiers added under `reference/`
- ✓ Local-first, multi-provider binding model confirmed
- ✓ Normalized fields, content ownership, mutation authority, reconciliation, closeout, and transport policy confirmed
- ✓ Discovery HiLL checkpoint approved
- ✓ Specification complete
- ✓ Full technical design drafted
- ✓ Design review loop 1 received and all findings resolved in artifacts
- ✓ Design review loop 2 received; final narrow findings resolved in artifacts
- ✓ Specification and design HiLL checkpoints completed under the user's unattended approval
- ✓ Implementation plan drafted with requirement-to-task traceability
- ✓ High-dispatch structured plan self-review passed after bounded remediation
- ✓ First external plan gate received; all findings resolved in artifacts
- ✓ External Cursor fallback re-gate passed with zero findings
- ✓ User-selected Cursor Fable gate passed and its artifact was received
- ✓ Plan complete
- ✓ p01-t01 defined ownership-safe remote configuration types and parsing
- ✓ p01-t02 resolved local, user, and built-in transport preferences
- ✓ p01-t03 exposed ownership-safe remote config commands
- ✓ p01-t04 defined strict versioned remote record schemas
- ✓ p01-t05 resolved privacy-aware portable and operational storage
- ✓ p01-t06 added restart-safe atomic remote persistence
- ✓ p01-t07 preserved simultaneous operation journals and conflict evidence
- ✓ p01-t08 added a backward-compatible association codec
- ✓ p01-t09 added foundational credential-safe remote doctor checks
- ✓ p01-t10 persisted pre-create intent and gated portable metadata on durable
  remote identity verification
- ✓ Phase 1 tasks complete and phase-wide verification passed
- ✓ Phase 1 operator-extension fix committed as `a13b3b4a8`
- ✓ Phase 1 operator-extension review passed at `c8ef3d593`
- ✓ p02-t01 composed binding-purpose policies by strict intersection
- ✓ p02-t02 projected only explicit backlog and project publication content
- ✓ p02-t03 sanitized bounded remote snapshots before retention or display
- ✓ p02-t04 preserved surrounding Markdown through fail-closed managed regions
- ✓ p02-t05 classified governed fields with pure three-way reconciliation
- ✓ p02-t06 resolved exact fail-closed authority with source traces
- ✓ p02-t07 bound previews and approvals to every load-bearing input
- ✓ p02-t08 enforced terminal-safe operation and composite substep reduction
- ✓ p02-t09 required authoritative postcondition verification before success
- ✓ Phase 2 review round 1 Critical and Important findings fixed in
  `bbbb3857c`
- ✓ Phase 2 review round 2 Critical findings fixed in `eed80d5ab`
- ⚠ Phase 2 final normal review blocked with 1 Critical and 2 Medium findings
- ⧗ One additional bounded Phase 2 fix/review cycle authorized
- ✓ Operator-extension credential-boundary fix committed as `831e110be`
- ⚠ Phase 2 operator review blocked with 2 Critical and 2 Medium findings
- ✓ Approved field-safety and host-execution boundary revision completed and
  passed a fresh cross-artifact plan-writing review in `a9aa20d52`
- ✓ p02-t10 replaced the retired credential parser with bounded whole-field
  suppression and explicit incompleteness evidence in `8fa237bdb`
- ✓ p02-t10 persistence compatibility fix committed as `ed0fe7758`
- ✓ Fresh Phase 2 review passed with 0 Critical, Important, Medium, or Minor
  findings

## Blockers

None. The prior operator-review failure remains historical evidence for the
retired parser design; it is no longer the active requirements blocker.

## Next Milestone

Begin Phase 3 at p03-t01 under the reviewed provider-neutral host-execution
contract.
