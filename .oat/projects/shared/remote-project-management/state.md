# Project State: remote-project-management

**Status:** Planning complete — ready for implementation
**Started:** 2026-03-15
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-30

## Current Phase

Planning — ready for implementation. The full implementation plan is drafted,
its structured self-review is clean, and both external Cursor review routes
passed after their artifact-local findings were resolved. The final
user-selected cursor-fable-5-xhigh gate was received and archived.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** `spec.md` (complete)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete)
- **Plan:** plan.md (complete; ready for implementation)
- **Implementation:** Not yet created

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Linear integration handover reference added (`reference/linear-integration-discovery-handover.md`)
- ✓ GitHub Issues, Linear, and Jira provider dossiers added under `reference/`
- ✓ Local-first, multi-provider binding model confirmed
- ✓ Normalized fields, content ownership, mutation authority, reconciliation, closeout, and transport policy confirmed
- ✓ Discovery HiLL checkpoint approved
- ✓ Specification complete
- ✓ Full technical design drafted
- ✓ Design review loop 1 received and all findings resolved in artifacts
- ✓ Design review loop 2 received; final narrow findings resolved in artifacts
- ✓ Specification and design HiLL checkpoints completed under the user's unattended approval
- ✓ Implementation plan drafted with requirement-to-task traceability
- ✓ High-dispatch structured plan self-review passed after bounded remediation
- ✓ First external plan gate received; all findings resolved in artifacts
- ✓ External Cursor fallback re-gate passed with zero findings
- ✓ User-selected Cursor Fable gate passed and its artifact was received
- ✓ Plan complete
- ⧗ Awaiting implementation

## Blockers

None.

## Next Milestone

Run oat-project-implement to confirm implementation HiLL checkpoints and any
parallel phase groups, then begin Phase 1.
