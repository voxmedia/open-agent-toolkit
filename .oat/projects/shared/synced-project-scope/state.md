# Project State: synced-project-scope

**Status:** Plan drafted — gate escalation pending
**Started:** 2026-08-26
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-26

## Current Phase

Plan - Drafted and self-reviewed; plan gate blocked twice, awaiting maintainer direction

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** `spec.md` (complete)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete — reviewed, 9 findings resolved)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (scaffolded template — not started)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (scaffolded template — not started)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Downstream lifecycle files scaffolded
- ✓ Discovery complete (seeded from brainstorm session 2026-08-26)
- ✓ Specification complete (folded into design)
- ✓ Design complete (artifact review passed after revisions)
- ✓ Plan drafted (38 tasks, 4 phases); structured self-review x2 applied
- ⧗ Plan gate: blocked on 2 attempts; findings applied; awaiting maintainer decision

## Blockers

- Plan gate exhausted its 2 attempts (both `blocked`); all findings applied except one product decision (list `local` projects?) resolved toward the spec by default. See `implementation.md` → Plan Gate Escalation.

## Next Milestone

Maintainer: confirm I3 (`local` unlisted) and authorize a third plan gate run or approve the plan; then `oat-project-implement`
