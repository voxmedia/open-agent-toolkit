# Implementation: Recon rework

**Started:** Not started — tracker initialized during planning on 2026-09-08.
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-09

The next task pointer identifies the first implementation task. The corrected
quick plan is accepted and ready; the cloud runner should load
`oat-project-implement`, confirm HiLL checkpoints, and start at `p01-t01`.

## Progress Overview

| Phase                                      | Status  | Tasks | Completed |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ----- | --------- |
| Phase 1: Decision and versioned contract   | pending | 2     | 0/2       |
| Phase 2: Proposal, conditions, integration | pending | 3     | 0/3       |
| Phase 3: Guidance and consumer output      | pending | 2     | 0/2       |
| Phase 4: Distribution and verification     | pending | 2     | 0/2       |

**Total:** 0/9 tasks completed. All implementation reviews pending.

## Phase Outcomes

No implementation phase has run. Add actual delivered behavior, exact commits,
verification commands/results, and deviations per phase during implementation.

## Implementation Log

### 2026-09-08 — Planning only

- User supplied the existing worktree and requested quick discovery capture,
  lightweight design, and plan drafting.
- User explicitly deferred self-review, artifact review, configured gates, and
  implementation to the receiving agent.
- Root retained design/plan synthesis; two bounded read-only workers mapped
  schema consumers and policy/test surfaces. They did not review these drafts.
- Scaffold created through the source CLI and committed at
  `dca0c54bfbe209107cd5bf8911319303112367b7`.
- Discovery completed through the CLI validation boundary.
- Draft design/plan, source map, and handoff authored. Plan was left pre-review
  at that handoff boundary.
- No product tests have run for the proposed implementation; it does not exist yet.

### 2026-09-09 — Manual plan artifact review received

- Received `artifact-plan-review-2026-09-09T163711Z.md`: 0 critical,
  3 important, 5 medium, and 4 minor findings.
- Applied all 12 findings directly to the reviewed planning artifacts; no
  implementation tasks or product-code changes were created.
- Dispositions: I1-I3, M1-M5, and m1-m4 all `resolve_in_artifact`.
- Archived the consumed event under `reviews/archived/`; its Reviews ledger row is
  `fixes_completed` until plan re-review passes.
- Next: resume quick-start for plan re-review, remaining design review, gate choices,
  and implementation-readiness checks.

### 2026-09-09 — Newer plan re-review received

- Received `artifact-plan-review-2026-09-09T232155Z.md`: 0 critical,
  1 important, 2 medium, and 3 minor findings.
- Resolved all six directly in `plan.md`; no implementation tasks or product-code
  changes were added.
- Dispositions: I1, M1-M2, and m1-m3 all `resolve_in_artifact`. M1 was narrowed:
  sharing production logic is required, while either a direct import or subprocess
  CLI invocation is a valid fixture boundary. m3 adds only the requested evidence
  distinction and no additional machinery.
- Archived the consumed event under `reviews/archived/`; its Reviews ledger row is
  `fixes_completed`, not passed.
- The separately received topology review remains active and must compose with
  these fixes before readiness.

### 2026-09-09 — Topology plan review received

- Received `artifact-plan-review-2026-09-09T231851Z.md`: 0 critical,
  2 important, 0 medium, and 0 minor findings.
- Resolved both directly in `design.md` and `plan.md`; no implementation tasks or
  product-code changes were added.
- Dispositions: I1-I2 both `resolve_in_artifact`. The approved topology has an
  optional adversary-mode contradiction-resolution evidence pass followed by
  exactly one terminal reconcile pass with its own approved target. The caller
  retains interpretation and sufficiency judgment.
- `reconciliation-needs-judgment` is now explicit: select an adequate terminal
  target before approval when foreseeable; otherwise preserve evidence and return
  an unresolved/out-of-envelope gap for renewed approval instead of substituting
  evidence search or launching a second reconciliation.
- Archived the consumed event under `reviews/archived/`; its ledger row is
  `fixes_completed`, not passed.
- The three-cycle automated plan-review cap is reached. It stops another automated
  cycle and does not turn unresolved or corrected findings into a pass.

### 2026-09-09 — Corrected plan manually accepted

- Thomas accepted the corrected aggregate plan, directed that it be marked
  `passed`, selected managed `frontier` dispatch, and authorized pushing the branch
  for cloud execution.
- Advanced only the final appended plan review event to `passed`; earlier events
  retain their historical `fixes_completed` status.
- Marked the quick plan complete and ready for `oat-project-implement`. The
  configured quick-start gate is disabled for this project so manual acceptance at
  the three-cycle cap does not trigger a fourth planning review.
- No optional cross-runtime phase gate was selected. Implementation and final
  review behavior remain unchanged. HiLL selection remains deferred to
  `oat-project-implement` start.
- Dispatch ladder preflight was complete; the project ceiling changed from managed
  `high` to managed `frontier` without persisting a concrete provider target.

## Deviations from Standard Quick-Start Completion

The user requested a deliberate pre-review handoff. Three plan-review cycles were
received and their findings applied. At the automated-review cap, Thomas manually
accepted the corrected aggregate plan, selected managed `frontier`, and directed
the readiness transition. The project-specific quick-start gate override records
that no fourth planning review should run; implementation/final reviews remain.

## Test Results

No implementation suite results. Bootstrap build output is environment setup,
not evidence that the proposed recon behavior works.

## Final Summary (for PR/docs)

Nothing shipped. This branch currently contains planning artifacts only.
Fill this section with actual behavior and verification after implementation.
