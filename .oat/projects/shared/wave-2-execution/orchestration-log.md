# Orchestration Log: wave-2-execution

Running log of orchestration and subagent observations for this project. Two
audiences: (1) evaluating this wave's execution specifically, and (2) collecting
general feedback on OAT orchestration/tooling and on the `oat-wave-execute` skill
itself — bugs, friction, and things that worked well.

**Logging contract (for the orchestrator and any lifecycle skill touching this
project):** append an entry whenever something breaks, surprises, requires a
workaround, or works notably well. Structural entries (dispatch stamps, gate
results, STOP/park events, bootstrap statuses, disposition maps) are appended as
one-liners referencing artifacts by path; judgment entries are agent-authored.
Never delete entries; strike through with a correction note if one turns out
wrong. Version-stamp tool-related observations. Keep entries short and factual.
Run `pnpm format:fix` on this file after writing. Tag entries that bear on the
wave-skill's design with a **Skill signal (strengthens/contradicts/gap):** line —
those drive the upstream implementation.

**Entry format:**

    ### YYYY-MM-DD · [project | general] · [bug | friction | worked-well | feedback] · <area>
    What happened (1-3 sentences). Impact/workaround. Follow-up (backlog / upstream / none).

**Structural entry format (skill-appended):**

    ### YYYY-MM-DD · structural · <skill> · <scope>
    One-line mirror of the skill's structured output. Reference artifacts by path.

## Entries

### 2026-09-06 · structural · oat-wave-execute · preflight

`wave-2-execution` created from `origin/main`
`90883f9bcfb0bc52a2fd58571542d194f71ee585` (W1 merged as PR #262 `6db0457c0`,
wave-close PR #263). `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm build`, and
`pnpm type-check` exit 0. `oat --version` 0.2.55 against branch 0.2.56 (the
global CLI now trails the branch by one lockstep bump; lanes use
`pnpm run cli --` for branch behavior). `ListAgents` showed no other busy
session on this worktree. Remote name will be `origin/wave-2-execution-2026-09`
(rule-1 deviation carried from W1).

## End-of-run synthesis (pending — do not skip at project completion)

At project completion, BEFORE any archive step, the orchestrator writes:
(1) verdicts on the conventions this wave exercised, with evidence entries cited;
(2) a ruling on every "Skill signal"-tagged entry — what the `oat-wave-execute`
skill should change; (3) adjustments adopted for later waves, stated as rules;
(4) a graduated-entries ledger (backlog IDs / upstream refs / closed-with-evidence
/ open-with-owner).

Roll-up ordering (critical): `summary.md` `## Workflow Observations` and any
repo-level ledger updates happen BEFORE `oat-project-complete` archives this file.
