# Project State: wave-2-execution

**Status:** Implementation in progress (p01, solo)
**Started:** 2026-08-26
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-26

## Current Phase

Implementation — p01 dispatched on the integration checkout; root owns review, fix loops, and closeout gates.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete — inherited wave contract + Wave 2 decisions + W1-adopted rules)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** N/A (quick mode unless lightweight design is needed)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete — wrapper plan; drift refresh recorded)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (in progress — Run 1)
- **Orchestration log:** `orchestration-log.md` (day one)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery complete
- ✓ Wave-boundary drift refresh: 1 PASS / 0 MINOR-DRIFT / 0 STOP
- ✓ Plan complete (validate-plan passed)
- ✓ Plan gate passed on round 3 (rounds 1–2 blocked on wrapper-contract items, fixed)
- ⧗ Implementation Run 1: p01 (solo)

## Blockers

None

## Next Milestone

p01 implementer returns → phase review → closeout sequence (DoD → synthesis → backlog archival → final review → exit gate → summary/document/PR).
