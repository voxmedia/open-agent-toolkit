# Project State: review-plan-workflow

**Status:** Phase 2 manual review pending
**Started:** 2026-07-29
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Current Phase

Phase 1 is complete and independently reviewed. The operator authorized a
review-limit override, and p02-t50 through p02-t53 plus one bounded fixture
recovery are complete and verified. Exactly one manual independent review is
authorized before Phase 2 disposition.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** `spec.md` (complete)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (in progress)
- **References:** original slow-review proposal and current-state handoff

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Execution artifacts scaffolded
- ✓ Backlog item linked
- ✓ Original feedback preserved under project references
- ✓ Current-state and fresh-thread handoff captured
- ✓ Discovery populated from incident evidence and repository contracts
- ✓ Fresh-thread baseline and first implementation slice revalidated
- ✓ Promoted to spec-driven workflow
- ✓ Requirements confirmed and written to `spec.md`
- ✓ Complete design draft prepared
- ✓ First holistic design feedback incorporated
- ✓ Final summary-list correction incorporated
- ✓ Independent cross-section consistency review passed
- ✓ Planning-readiness contract gaps resolved and re-review passed
- ✓ Design gate resolved (no configured gate)
- ✓ Design completed
- ✓ Implementation plan confirmed
- ✓ Managed plan artifact review passed after bounded fixes
- ✓ Manual plan artifact review received and resolved
- ✓ Universal 20-minute artifact-review default added to the project scope
- ⚠ Configured cross-family plan gate timed out without output
- ✓ Operator manually accepted the residual planning-gate risk and unblocked
  implementation
- ✓ Implementation dispatch preflight resolved Tier 1 under managed High policy
- ✓ Phase 1 completed (13/13 tasks) and passed independent review
- ✓ Phase 2 tasks p02-t01 through p02-t29 completed
- ✓ Operator-authorized p02-t03 recovery commit passed focused tests and lint
- ✓ Operator-authorized p02-t27/t28 composition recovery passed focused tests,
  type-check, and lint
- ✓ Phase 2 verification passed
- ⚠ Independent Phase 2 review failed at reviewed head `d6c20451`
- ✓ Review fixes p02-t30 through p02-t34 completed
- ✓ p02-t35 append-only lint recovery passed focused tests and lint
- ✓ Review fixes p02-t36 through p02-t43 completed
- ✓ Full CLI suite passed 3,756 tests; package lint and diff-check pass
- ✓ p02-t39 compile-time fixture recovery passed package and workspace checks
- ⚠ Phase 2 fix re-review failed at reviewed head `f7452e5b`
- ⚠ p02-t44 committed and passed focused tests, then failed package lint
- ✓ Standing operator authorization granted for narrow append-only recoveries
- ✓ p02-t44 recovery and p02-t45 through p02-t49 completed
- ✓ Second-cycle Phase 2 verification passed
- ⚠ Third automatic Phase 2 review failed at head `f179344b`
- ⚠ Automatic review limit reached (3 of 3)
- ✓ Operator authorized p02-t50 through p02-t53 and one manual review
- ✓ p02-t50 through p02-t53 completed at head `a2605f96`
- ✓ 3,791 CLI tests, package lint/type-check, and critical root verification pass
- → Single manual independent Phase 2 review pending

## Blockers

None.

## Next Milestone

Run and receive the single authorized manual independent Phase 2 review against
the final repair range.
