# Project State: wave-4-execution

**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Started:** 2026-09-06
**Last Updated:** 2026-09-06

## Current Phase

Implementation — all three lanes merged (lockstep 0.2.59); final review passed; configured exit gate next, then the post-implement sequence.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** N/A (quick mode unless lightweight design is needed)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; three pointer-only tasks, groups [p01, p02] then p03)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (3/3 tasks; three lanes merged; final review passed)

## Progress

- ✓ Preflight: `wave-4-execution` created from `origin/main` `0af558db80068649fb8858be7a98c635e6f12f3d`; install, build, type-check green
- ✓ Wave-boundary drift refresh (recon, non-authoritative) recorded in `plan.md`
- ✓ Wrapper artifacts written and `oat project validate-plan` passed
- ✓ Plan gate passed (0 findings)
- ✓ Group 1 (p01 + p02) merged (`034780db0`, `6a09a6bd2`); lockstep 0.2.59 + manifest restamp (`0bb028ca2`); eight gates green
- ✓ p03 merged (`92da1d57b`); eight gates green, lockstep retained
- ✓ Backlog archived (3) and follow-ups filed (4); synthesis written
- ✓ Final review passed (round 1 0C/3I/4M/4m → fixes `f46465dd2`, `375c740ed`, `f6128f017`, `945d3e2d4` → round 2 0C/0I/0M/2m)
- ⧗ Configured exit gate, post-implement sequence

## Blockers

None

## Next Milestone

Configured exit gate (foreground) on the closeout head, then summary / document / pr.
