# Project State: recon-skill

**Status:** Implementation in progress / PR open
**Started:** 2026-08-30
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-31

## Current Phase

Implementing p02-t04 review fixes - packet workflow assurance contracts

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete; independent review passed)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; independent and external reviews passed)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (initialized; starts at p01-t01)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Execution artifacts scaffolded
- ✓ Brainstorm decisions captured
- ✓ Invocation, rigor-profile, destination, failure, and source boundaries resolved
- ✓ Lightweight design selected
- ✓ Architecture approved
- ✓ Component design approved
- ✓ Remaining design sections completed
- ✓ Independent design self-review passed after bounded corrections
- ✓ Discovery marked complete for quick-start planning
- ✓ Implementation plan drafted with 4 phases and 11 tasks
- ✓ Independent plan self-review passed after bounded corrections
- ✓ External plan gate passed after one corrective review round
- ✓ Gate artifacts received and archived with residual risk disposition
- ✓ Implementation tracking initialized at p01-t01
- ✓ Planning PR opened as #248
- ✓ Implementation started with a final-phase HiLL checkpoint at p04
- ✓ p01 passed independent review after one bounded fix iteration
- ⧗ p02 correction round 3 authorized; bounded fix and fresh independent
  review are in progress

## Blockers

None

## Next Milestone

Complete the authorized p02 correction round and obtain a passing fresh
independent review
