# Project State: recon-skill

**Status:** Implementation in progress / PR open
**Started:** 2026-08-30
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-31

## Current Phase

Implementation - Final review passed; awaiting configured exit gate

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete; independent review passed)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; independent and external reviews passed)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (16/16 tasks complete; terminal review pending)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Execution artifacts scaffolded
- ✓ Brainstorm decisions captured
- ✓ Invocation, rigor-profile, destination, failure, and source boundaries resolved
- ✓ Lightweight design selected
- ✓ Architecture approved
- ✓ Component design approved
- ✓ Remaining design sections completed
- ✓ Independent design self-review passed after bounded corrections
- ✓ Discovery marked complete for quick-start planning
- ✓ Implementation plan drafted with 4 phases and 11 tasks
- ✓ Independent plan self-review passed after bounded corrections
- ✓ External plan gate passed after one corrective review round
- ✓ Gate artifacts received and archived with residual risk disposition
- ✓ Implementation tracking initialized at p01-t01
- ✓ Planning PR opened as #248
- ✓ Implementation started with a final-phase HiLL checkpoint at p04
- ✓ p01 passed independent review after one bounded fix iteration
- ✓ Revision p-rev1 created to replace incremental validator patches with one
  normalized validation boundary
- ✓ p-rev1 implementation completed as two bounded commits; all five round-4
  bypasses reject in direct probes and the overengineering assessment passed
- ✓ p-rev1 review round 1 found two Important adjacent invariant gaps
- ✓ One bounded append-only fix closed publication-root and receipt-drift gaps
- ✓ Fresh independent re-review closed receipt drift and all five round-4
  assurance bypasses
- ✓ One Important residual required ineligible audit source paths to retain
  canonical identities before eligibility branching
- ✓ Bounded two-file fix covers stale, invalid, and unavailable variants
- ✓ Final fresh re-review closed every existing representation and prior
  Critical/Important finding
- ✓ One Important dual URL declaration ambiguity required the final configured
  correction round
- ✓ Dual URL capture representations now reject as an exclusive-union violation
- ✓ Terminal p-rev1 review passed with zero findings and explicitly closed the
  complete p02 blocking review history
- ✓ Phase 2 and revision p-rev1 passed after three authorized revision fix rounds
- ✓ Phase 3 implementation completed as four planned commits
- ✓ Research pack ownership, user-agent materialization, bundle inventory, and
  project provider behavior passed independent review
- ⧗ Phase 3 review found three Important lifecycle defects requiring one
  bounded fix and fresh re-review
- ✓ One bounded append-only fix closes the three reproduced lifecycle defects
  without adding a generalized state simulator
- ✓ Fresh re-review closed all three first-round findings
- ⧗ One Critical user-sync regression and two Important adjacent lifecycle
  findings require a second bounded fix
- ✓ Second bounded fix closes the three round-2 findings; root pre-review
  correction preserves installed-agent ordinary planning for Claude
- ✓ Third review closes all six prior p03 findings
- ⧗ One Important partial-overlap selected-asset case requires the third and
  final configured fix round
- ✓ Final bounded fix enforces per-asset final-consumer retention and
  verification in both request orders
- ✓ Terminal Phase 3 review passed with zero findings and closed all seven
  prior Critical/Important findings
- ✓ Phase 4 documentation and lockstep `0.2.51` release preparation completed
- ✓ Terminal Phase 4 review passed with zero findings and no overengineering
- ✓ All 13 implementation and revision tasks complete
- ⧗ Final lifecycle review found one Critical approval-envelope binding gap
- ✓ Revision task prev2-t01 binds the complete canonical dispatch projection
- ✓ Exhaustive deletion and receipt-mutation coverage passes
- ⧗ Final re-review found receipt-chain causality/freshness and canonical array
  value gaps
- ✓ Tasks prev2-t02 and prev2-t03 close the terminal-cycle findings
- ✓ Root load-bearing verification passes 64/64 focused tests
- ✓ Third and terminal final review passed with zero findings
- ✓ Phase p-rev2 passed without overengineering
- ⧗ Awaiting the configured implementation exit gate

## Blockers

None.

## Next Milestone

Pass the configured implementation exit gate, then run pre-approved closeout
steps and request final HiLL approval
