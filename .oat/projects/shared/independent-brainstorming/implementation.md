# Implementation: independent-brainstorming

**Started:** 2026-05-01
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-01

> This document is used to resume interrupted implementation sessions.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, ensure `## Final Summary (for PR/docs)` is filled with what was actually implemented.

## Review History

### Review Received: design (artifact)

**Date:** 2026-05-01
**Review artifact:** `reviews/archived/artifact-design-review-2026-05-01.md`

**Findings:**

- Critical: 0
- Important: 1 (`I1`: default user-scope installer behavior)
- Medium: 1 (`M1`: fold-back commit-safety contract)
- Minor: 1 (`m1`: dogfood scenario count wording)

**Disposition:** all three resolved in artifact (`resolve_in_artifact`).

**Edits applied to `design.md`:**

- `I1`: added "Pack-default-scope metadata" subsection to Component B specifying `PACK_METADATA` with `defaultScope: 'user' | 'project'`, installer changes for both interactive picker and non-interactive resolution paths, and required test coverage. Updated Component B design decisions to call out metadata-driven defaults.
- `M1`: added "Fold-back commit safety contract" subsection under Architecture covering preflight `git status` check, clean / dirty / abort paths, scoped staging discipline, and the rule that the handoff prompt prints only after the scoped commit succeeds.
- `m1`: clarified Dogfood scenarios paragraph to describe ten scenarios across nine destination families (with doc-to-path split into in-repo / off-repo cases).

**No plan tasks created** (artifact reviews resolve in-place per skill convention).

**Next:** continue to plan generation via `oat-project-quick-start` (re-review optional; the user opted to proceed without re-review for these targeted edits).

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_
_- Phase Outcomes table_
_- Parallel Groups list_
_- Outstanding Items_

<!-- orchestration-runs-start -->

_Orchestration runs from `oat-project-implement` are appended here, most-recent-first within the file but append-only at the bottom of the log._
