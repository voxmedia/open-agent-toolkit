# Implementation: aws-profile

**Started:** 2026-04-28
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-28

> This document is used to resume interrupted implementation sessions.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, ensure `## Final Summary (for PR/docs)` is filled with what was actually implemented.

## Progress Overview

| Phase   | Status      | Tasks | Completed |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | --------- |
| Phase 1 | in_progress | N     | 0/N       |
| Phase 2 | pending     | N     | 0/N       |

**Total:** 0/{N} tasks completed

## Phase 1: {Phase Name}

**Status:** in_progress
**Started:** 2026-04-28

### Phase Summary (fill when phase is complete)

**Outcome (what changed):**

- {2-5 bullets describing user-visible / behavior-level changes delivered in this phase}

**Key files touched:**

- `{path}` - {why}

**Verification:**

- Run: `{command(s)}`
- Result: {pass/fail + notes}

**Notes / Decisions:**

- {trade-offs or deviations discovered during implementation}

### Task p01-t01: {Task Name}

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_
_- Phase Outcomes table_
_- Parallel Groups list_
_- Outstanding Items_

<!-- orchestration-runs-start -->

### Run 1 — 2026-04-28 23:55

**Branch:** chore/scope-s3-sync-profile-override
**Tier:** 1
**Policy:** merge-strategy=merge, retry-limit=2

#### Phase Outcomes

| Phase | Implementer | Review | Fix Iterations | Disposition |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| p01   | done        | pass   | 0/2            | merged      |
| p02   | done        | pass   | 1/2            | merged      |

#### Parallel Groups

- Group 1 [p02, p03]: degraded to sequential inline — Agent worktree isolation branched from primary repo's `main` instead of orchestration branch HEAD, so neither phase could see p01's commits. Skill's degradation rule applied; running phases sequentially in this checkout instead of parallel worktrees.
- Singletons: p01 (sequential), p04 (sequential), p05 (sequential)

#### Outstanding Items

- p02 carried Minor findings: (a) plan p02-t01 Step-1 test description still says "overridden when config provides one" — contradicts implemented behavior; cosmetic drift. (b) Optional completion-path-explicit "both parent env + options" test not yet added; helper-level coverage already pins behavior. Neither blocks.
