# Implementation: backlog-wave-4

**Started:** 2026-10-02
**Last Updated:** 2026-10-02

> This document is used to resume interrupted implementation sessions.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, fill the Final Summary (for PR/docs) section below with what was actually implemented.

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_
_- Phase Outcomes table_
_- Parallel Groups list_
_- Outstanding Items_

<!-- orchestration-runs-start -->

_Orchestration runs from `oat-project-implement` are appended here, most-recent-first within the file but append-only at the bottom of the log._

## Deviations from Plan / Design

Document any intentional deviations from the original plan, spec, or design. Include accepted review findings where the shipped implementation is source of truth and a lifecycle artifact needs alignment.

| Task / Review | Source Artifact | Planned / Documented | Actual / Accepted | Reason | Source of Truth | Follow-up |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| -             | -               | -                    | -                 | -      | -               | -         |

## Test Results

Track test execution during implementation.

| Phase | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | -         | -      | -      | -        |
| 2     | -         | -      | -      | -        |

## Quick-start Gate Escalation

The configured quick-start gate (`onFailure: block`, `maxAttempts: 2`,
target `codex-6-sol-xhigh`, `gpt-6.1-sol` xhigh) blocked on both attempts:

- Attempt 1 (run `cf4607a4`): 2 High. H1, quick-start completion with no
  configured gate; H2, the complete-auto PR-merge guard against
  wave-execute's completion-before-merge step. Both were resolved in the plan
  (p04-t06, p05-t02, p05-t03).
- Attempt 2 (run `fe6bbe0a`): 1 High. p01-t01 guarded only the docs tree,
  while staging must stay outside every recursively copied source (skills,
  templates, docs). Resolved in p01-t01 after the attempt; not re-gated.

Attempts are exhausted, so this is a `QS-12` repository-policy boundary under
`OAT_AUTONOMOUS=1`: the operator decides how to proceed. Each round found a
real but narrower contract gap (round 1: two composition gaps; round 2: one
scoped safety invariant), and no finding was rejected.

**Operator disposition (2026-10-02, `QS-12` boundary):** After the
complexity review (`reviews/archived/complexity-plan-2026-10-02T1520Z.md`,
verdict partially compliant, recommended disposition **simplify**), the
operator chose **simplify, then implement** without another plan-gate cycle;
next and progress report the quick-start record only; the recorded pre-merge
exception stays. On the operator's request for a recommendation, the agent
kept batch completion mode and dropped the idle kill
(`BL-260711-add-activity-aware-gate`) and the early-trigger config key. The
plan was revised accordingly (24 tasks); every phase remains gated.
