# Project State: markdown-docs-bootstrap

**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Started:** 2026-09-30
**Last Updated:** 2026-10-01

## Current Phase

Implementation setup complete. p01 complete; p02-t01 complete, additive adoption/dry-run next; standard root-owned reviews run after each phase and the final HiLL checkpoint follows p04.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete; CLI validation passed)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete; approved dispositions incorporated)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; ready for oat-project-implement)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (tracking initialized; 3/9 tasks completed)

## Progress

- Discovery and approved lightweight design complete
- Four sequential phases and nine executable tasks planned
- All user-approved review edits applied
- Final cross-runtime gate passed; both Low findings dispositioned as already-covered scope
- Plan readiness validated; first task p01-t01

## Review Setup

- Project dispatch: High (managed; project state only)
- Additional cross-runtime phase gate: Disabled by user; setting remains absent
- Configured quick-start and implementation lifecycle gates: Keep both; no override map
- Implementation-phase HiLL: final phase p04, automatic review enabled (effective workflow configuration)

## Review Evidence

See `reviews/design-consensus-handoff.md`, automatic review handoffs, and `reviews/plan-gate-final-handoff.md`. Historical raw counts and actual review statuses are preserved; no implementation is claimed.

## Blockers

None

## Next Milestone

Continue p02-t02 through the same accepted phase implementer.
