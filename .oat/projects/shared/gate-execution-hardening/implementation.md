# Implementation: gate-execution-hardening

**Started:** 2026-07-15
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-15

> This document is used to resume interrupted implementation sessions.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, ensure `## Final Summary (for PR/docs)` is filled with what was actually implemented.

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_
_- Phase Outcomes table_
_- Parallel Groups list_
_- Outstanding Items_

<!-- orchestration-runs-start -->

_Orchestration runs from `oat-project-implement` are appended here, most-recent-first within the file but append-only at the bottom of the log._

## Deviations from Plan / Design

Document any intentional deviations from the original plan, spec, or design. Include accepted review findings where the shipped implementation is source of truth and a lifecycle artifact needs alignment.

| Task / Review | Source Artifact | Planned / Documented | Actual / Accepted | Reason | Source of Truth | Follow-up |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| -             | -               | -                    | -                 | -      | -               | -         |

## Test Results

Track test execution during implementation.

| Phase | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | -         | -      | -      | -        |
| 2     | -         | -      | -      | -        |

## Final Summary (for PR/docs)

**What shipped:**

- {capability 1}
- {capability 2}

**Behavioral changes (user-facing):**

## Gate Feedback (plan artifact gate — attempts exhausted, escalated 2026-07-15)

Two cross-runtime gate runs on the completed plan (`onFailure: block`, `maxAttempts: 2`), after the plan had already passed a 3-round in-session structured review:

- Attempt 1 (`reviews/artifact-plan-review-2026-07-15T215828Z.md`): 3 Important + 2 Medium — scope-aware budget defaults missing (`reviewScope` not a resolver input); stale "pending" phase-gate checklist item contradicting plan-complete frontmatter; completion-safety lane not verifying the real review-provide lifecycle; asset-verification ordering guaranteed to fail; Cursor nested transcript layout unpinned. All remediated (commits `3fcc669d`..`5be65f7a`).
- Attempt 2 (`reviews/artifact-plan-review-2026-07-15T221501Z.md`): 2 Important (residuals of attempt-1 remediations) — `type-default`/30-min labels left stale in design data-flow + both fixture matrices, conflicting with the new `scope-default` buckets; completion-safety lane defects (untracked `--no-commit` fixture would trip review-provide's baseline contract, installed-binary invocation instead of repo-source CLI, missing runnable Cursor command). All remediated (commit `554ad580`): all budget-source labels aligned to `scope-default` with scope buckets named; fixture lane rewritten with committed scaffold, `pnpm run cli --` invocations, and both runnable lane commands.

Escalation: attempts exhausted with all findings remediated and both rounds converging (3I+2M → 2I, all residuals consistency-precision items rather than new defects). Operator decision required: accept the remediated plan as implementation-ready, or authorize a third gate run outside the attempt budget.
