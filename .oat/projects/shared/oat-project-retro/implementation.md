# Implementation: oat-project-retro

**Started:** 2026-08-05
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-05

## Gate Escalation Record (planning gate, attempts exhausted)

The `oat-project-quick-start` exit gate (`oat gate review`, artifact/plan,
threshold important, maxAttempts 2) blocked twice; per `onFailure: block` the
accumulated feedback is recorded here and escalated to the human.

**Attempt 1** — `reviews/artifact-plan-review-2026-08-06T002316Z.md`
(3 Important, 1 Medium; all fixed and committed in `37d94a3fb`):

1. Retro accepted in `preApproval` violated the discovery Q3 evidence
   boundary → plan/design now specify postApproval-only with normalization
   rejection + tests.
2. Docs nav map (`workflows/projects/index.md`) missing from p04-t02 file
   set → added.
3. `pnpm release:validate` ran before dogfood fixes → p05 tasks swapped
   (dogfood first, bump+validate last).
4. Apply-mode dogfood step lacked a consent boundary → explicit per-item
   interactive approval / pre-approved reversible non-interactive target.

**Attempt 2** — `reviews/artifact-plan-review-2026-08-06T004058Z.md`
(2 Important; disposition pending human direction):

1. Repo-lane filing candidates lack an item contract (no
   apply-vs-file discriminator on RP items; `code-follow-up` routing
   ambiguous; `oat_retro_filing` rollup underivable).
2. p04-t01 omits the existing `workflow.postImplementSequence` config
   reference entry, which would ship stale vocabulary.

> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, ensure `## Final Summary (for PR/docs)` is filled with what was actually implemented.

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_

## Deviations from Plan / Design

Document any intentional deviations from the original plan, spec, or design. Include accepted review findings where the shipped implementation is source of truth and a lifecycle artifact needs alignment.

| Task / Review | Source Artifact | Planned / Documented | Actual / Accepted | Reason | Source of Truth | Follow-up |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| -             | -               | -                    | -                 | -      | -               | -         |

## Test Results

Track test execution during implementation.

| Phase | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | -         | -      | -      | -        |
| 2     | -         | -      | -      | -        |

## Final Summary (for PR/docs)
