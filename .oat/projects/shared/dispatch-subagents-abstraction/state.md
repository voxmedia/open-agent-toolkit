# Project State: dispatch-subagents-abstraction

**Status:** Lightweight design complete
**Started:** 2026-07-12
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-12

## Current Phase

Design complete - Ready for direct skill authoring outside `oat-project-implement`

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** `design.md` (complete lightweight design)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (untouched scaffold; retrospective backfill only)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (untouched scaffold; retrospective backfill only)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery complete
- ✓ Lightweight design complete
- ✓ Execution artifacts scaffolded
- ⧗ Direct skill authoring and Claude review next

## Blockers

None

## Next Milestone

Author and review the two skills directly, then backfill plan and implementation history
