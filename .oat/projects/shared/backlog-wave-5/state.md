# Project State: backlog-wave-5

**Status:** In progress — approved final-test corrections
**Started:** 2026-10-03
**Last Updated:** 2026-10-04

## Current Phase

Implementation - Tasks complete; awaiting final verification and review

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** N/A (quick mode unless lightweight design is needed)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete, ready for implementation)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (authoritative task ledger and verification evidence)

## Progress

- ✓ Discovery started
- ✓ Execution artifacts scaffolded
- ✓ Approved ten-ticket requirements captured
- ✓ Required plan reviews received; complexity check complete

## Blockers

None. User approved three serial final-test tasks and delegated routine continuation. Prior failed verification remains evidence; no final pass inferred.

## Next Milestone

Execute remaining approved/delegated p06-t03 through t07, then restart final ordered gates before native final review, configured p06/implementation gates, explicit prior-finding dispositions and preapproval/HiLL/one-PR tail. All32original tasks remain complete; no PR created.

### Approved continuation — 2026-10-04

Resume p03-t12 diagnostics-only correction and one further exact native/configured review cycle. Automatic rewritten-history recovery deferred; six Lows final-owned. No counter reset. Required decision now settled; remaining sequential wave continues after this cycle passes.

Latest operator direction: take project through verified completion/one mergeable PR; ask only if consequential judgment or external blocker requires user. No merge or release authorized.
