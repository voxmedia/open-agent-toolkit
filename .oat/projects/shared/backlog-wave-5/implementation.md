# Implementation: backlog-wave-5

**Started:** 2026-10-03
**Last Updated:** 2026-10-03

> This document is used to resume interrupted implementation sessions.
>
> Conventions:
>
> - `oat_current_task_id` always points at the **next plan task to do** (not the last completed task).
> - When all plan tasks are complete, set `oat_current_task_id: null`.
> - Reviews are **not** plan tasks. Track review status in `plan.md` under `## Reviews` (e.g., `| final | code | passed | ... |`).
> - Keep phase/task statuses consistent with the Progress Overview table so restarts resume correctly.
> - Before running the `oat-project-pr-final` skill, fill the Final Summary (for PR/docs) section below with what was actually implemented.

## Progress Overview

| Phase   | Status      | Tasks | Completed |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | --------- |

## Orchestration Runs

_Each run from `oat-project-implement` appends an entry below with:_
_- Run header (number, timestamp, branch, tier, policy, phase counts)_
_- Phase Outcomes table_
_- Parallel Groups list_
_- Outstanding Items_

<!-- orchestration-runs-start -->

_Orchestration runs from `oat-project-implement` are appended here, most-recent-first within the file but append-only at the bottom of the log._

<!-- orchestration-runs-end -->

## Deviations from Plan / Design

Document any intentional deviations from the original plan, spec, or design. Include accepted review findings where the shipped implementation is source of truth and a lifecycle artifact needs alignment.

| Task / Review | Source Artifact | Planned / Documented | Actual / Accepted | Reason | Source of Truth | Follow-up |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------- | ------ | --------------- | --------- |
| -             | -               | -                    | -                 | -      | -               | -         |

## Test Results

Track test execution during implementation.

| Phase | Tests Run | Passed | Failed | Coverage |
| ----- | --------- | ------ | ------ | -------- |
| 1     | -         | -      | -      | -        |
| 2     | -         | -      | -      | -        |

## Final Summary (for PR/docs)

**What shipped:**

- {capability 1}
- {capability 2}

**Behavioral changes (user-facing):**

- {bullet}

**Key files / modules:**

- `{path}` - {purpose}

**Verification performed:**

## Planning dispatch

- Request: wave5-plan-author-r1
- Caller: tackle-backlog / oat-project-quick-start
- Scope: discovery and plan artifacts for the approved ten-item wave
- Objective: draft the canonical artifacts from ticket requirements and current source
- Authority: write only discovery.md and plan.md; no product edits or Git mutations
- Task class: hard-reasoning (reconcile safety contracts and cross-surface dependencies)
- Dispatch: codex/gpt-6.1-sol/high (role: worker; exact native selection)
- Selection source: native-default; reason: native-catalog
- Policy source: project-state, managed high; complete configured ladder verified
- Guidance: subagent-orchestration/references/provider-codex.md, 2026-10-01, fresh
- Deadline: 1200 seconds; retry limit: 0; fallback: none
- Launch status: accepted
- Handle: /root/wave5_plan_author
- Terminal outcome: completed — six phases, 18 tasks, 40 acceptance rows; only assigned artifact writes
- Runtime confirmation: not-reported; configured invocation accepted by native host
- Expected handoff: two formatted artifacts, phase/task counts, source evidence and unresolved risks

The drafting worker cannot mark the plan ready. Automatic artifact review, the configured independent gate and complexity-review remain pending.

Plan author verification: current-source validate-plan, file-scoped formatting and diff checks passed. Root verified all 40 acceptance rows against the ten current tickets and corrected a Markdown table delimiter before the reviewed baseline.
