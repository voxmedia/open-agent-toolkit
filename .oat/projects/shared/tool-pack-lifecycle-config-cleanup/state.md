# Project State: Tool-Pack Lifecycle and Config Cleanup

**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Started:** 2026-08-27
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-29

## Current Phase

Both plan-declared parallel phases passed root review. Phase p01 passed after
one bounded append-only fix round; Phase p02 passed with one deferred Medium
test-coverage finding. Plan-order fan-in is next.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** N/A (straight-to-plan decision)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; 3 phases, 7 tasks after one review fix)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (in progress; 6/7 tasks complete)

## Progress

- ✓ Associated backlog item linked
- ✓ Five residual findings captured as a bounded Small follow-up
- ✓ Discovery completed without a lightweight design
- ✓ Managed High dispatch policy configured
- ✓ High plan review passed after two bounded refinements
- ✓ Cross-runtime plan gate passed after one receive/fix iteration
- ✓ p01 and p02 implementation completed in isolated worktrees
- ✓ Phase p01 review finding converted into bounded task `p01-t03`
- ✓ Phase p02 root review passed with no blocking findings
- ✓ Phase p01 Critical finding fixed in one append-only continuation commit
- ✓ Phase p01 narrowed re-review passed with zero findings

## Blockers

None.

## Next Milestone

Merge p01 and p02 in plan order with integration verification after each
fan-in, then begin p03 release integration.
