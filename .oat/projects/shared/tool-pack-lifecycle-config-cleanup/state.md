# Project State: Tool-Pack Lifecycle and Config Cleanup

**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Started:** 2026-08-27
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-29

## Current Phase

The plan-declared p01/p02 parallel implementation is complete. Phase p02 passed
root review with one deferred Medium test-coverage finding. Phase p01's bounded
Critical fix is complete and awaits narrowed independent re-review.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** N/A (straight-to-plan decision)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; 3 phases, 7 tasks after one review fix)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (in progress; 6/7 tasks complete)

## Progress

- ✓ Associated backlog item linked
- ✓ Five residual findings captured as a bounded Small follow-up
- ✓ Discovery completed without a lightweight design
- ✓ Managed High dispatch policy configured
- ✓ High plan review passed after two bounded refinements
- ✓ Cross-runtime plan gate passed after one receive/fix iteration
- ✓ p01 and p02 implementation completed in isolated worktrees
- ✓ Phase p01 review finding converted into bounded task `p01-t03`
- ✓ Phase p02 root review passed with no blocking findings
- ✓ Phase p01 Critical finding fixed in one append-only continuation commit

## Blockers

None.

## Next Milestone

Re-review the bounded p01 fix, then merge both passing phase ranges in plan
order.
