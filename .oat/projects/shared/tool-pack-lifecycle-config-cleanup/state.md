# Project State: Tool-Pack Lifecycle and Config Cleanup

**Status:** Implementation in progress
**Started:** 2026-08-27
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-29

## Current Phase

Phase p03 implementation and gates are complete at the append-only recovery
head. Root review found one Important planning-view alignment gap, converted
into bounded task `p03-t02` before closeout.

## Artifacts

- **Discovery:** `discovery.md` (complete)
- **Spec:** N/A (quick mode)
- **Design:** N/A (straight-to-plan decision)
- **Plan:** `plan.md` (complete; 3 phases, 8 tasks after two review fixes)
- **Implementation:** `implementation.md` (fixes added; 7/8 tasks complete)

## Progress

- ✓ Associated backlog item linked
- ✓ Five residual findings captured as a bounded Small follow-up
- ✓ Discovery completed without a lightweight design
- ✓ Managed High dispatch policy configured
- ✓ High plan review passed after two bounded refinements
- ✓ Cross-runtime plan gate passed after one receive/fix iteration
- ✓ p01 and p02 implementation completed in isolated worktrees
- ✓ Phase p01 review finding converted into bounded task `p01-t03`
- ✓ Phase p02 root review passed with no blocking findings
- ✓ Phase p01 Critical finding fixed in one append-only continuation commit
- ✓ Phase p01 narrowed re-review passed with zero findings
- ✓ p01/p02 merged in plan order; 495 combined focused tests passed
- ✓ Merged phase worktrees removed after clean fan-in
- ✓ Phase p03 docs, release integration, and backlog closure completed
- ✓ Phase p03 recovered one commit-composition defect append-only (1/10)
- ✓ All final authoritative gates passed
- ✓ Phase p03 release surfaces passed review; one planning-view fix added

## Blockers

None.

## Next Milestone

Complete `p03-t02` through the original implementer handle, then run narrowed
independent re-review.
